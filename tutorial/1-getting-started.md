# Step 1: Getting Started

## Whatâ€™s Required
For now, this tutorial is centered around iOS, and so instructions are tailored for Mac:

* An Apple computer with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed (version 5 required)
* Xcode command line tools.
  * Installation: `xcode-select --install`
  * If you get the error "Can't install the software because it is not currently available from the Software Update server", you may already have the tools installed.
* [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org)
  * Installation: `sudo gem install cocoapods`

## Next steps

Next, you'll be creating an [iOS](2-ios.md) or [Android](2-android.md) app.
