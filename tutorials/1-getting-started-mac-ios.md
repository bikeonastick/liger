# Step 1: Setting up your environment

It's time to get you set up to develop Liger iOS apps on a Mac. You can set yourself up for Android development as well, one doesn't exclude the other. If you are new to mobile development it can easily feel daunting to get to grips with new tools. We will do our best to guide you through it and show you the important bits.

# Xcode

* Get Apple Account
* Start app store
* Download XCode
* Start Xcode
* Install simulator (prompted when Xcode starts)
* Verify that you do indeed have version 5.0.2 or newer (screenshot!)
* Install command line tools (start terminal and type clang)

# Ruby

## Build in

If you don't plan on using Ruby for anything other than the tools you need for Liger you can install using the built in Ruby.

* Start terminal
* Type `gem install cocoapods`
* Type `pod setup`

## Using RVM

Link to RVM page, common with RoR developers, more advanced, tip to use .ruby-version / .ruby-gemset.
